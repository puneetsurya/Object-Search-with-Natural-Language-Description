# Object-Search-with-Natural-Language-Description
The aim for this project is to do research in the field of Artificial Intelligence that helps visually impaired people. The main goals that we observe in computer vision include: Detection, Segmentation, Localization,	Recognition of certain objects in an image.
#**Objectives**
The following measurable objectives have been identified:
Understand what objects are present. Label all the objects that are present in the scene.
Localizing the objects in 2D and 3D. For easy descriptive approach 
Determine the attributes and description of the objects and scenes in surrounding. Give a precise and rich details of what the objects are.
Having a clear characterization of relationship between the objects with a semantic description of the whole scene. This will best explain why an object is at that specific location and map the scene well.
#**Methodology**
MS COCO was chosen as our working dataset since is well designed for segmentation and detection of objects occurring in a natural context. We saw it best to limit our dataset to entry-level categories with an aim of collecting candidate images which are then grouped into iconic-object images which have large single large objects that are in a canonical perspective cantered in the image, iconic-scene images which are short and lack people and lastly non-iconic images. 
This Project is using dataset of image-caption pairs to train a CNN-RNN model to automatically generate images from captions.
